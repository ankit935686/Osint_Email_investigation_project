## ⚠️ Important Note

**This data is simulated** to demonstrate what REAL investigative intelligence looks like. 

In actual OSINT investigations, this type of data would come from:
- Public API access (with authentication)
- Data breaches (legal sources only)
- OSINT databases
- Social media scraping (within ToS)
- Legal requests to companies

This project shows the **STRUCTURE and PRESENTATION** of investigative intelligence, teaching proper data handling and analysis.

## ✅ Summary

Your project now shows **REAL INVESTIGATIVE DATA** that professionals use:

1. **Physical Locations** - Addresses, GPS, IP tracking
2. **Financial Intelligence** - Transactions, orders, payments
3. **Communication Networks** - Contacts, messages, calls
4. **Behavior Patterns** - Usage, preferences, changes
5. **Security Intelligence** - Logins, alerts, devices
